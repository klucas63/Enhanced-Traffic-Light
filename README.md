# 2 Direction Traffic Light With Pedestrian Crossing #
***DRAFT***
I am also new to Arduino so be kind, I may miss something. If you like this concept feel free to use this code. I however am doing this for free/fun so no warranty is implied. Use at your own risk.

I have some more testing to do and will update the code as I find things.

Open an issue if you have a comment, idea or bug.

# My Coding Environment #
- Windows 10
- Visual Studio Code, I started with Arduino IDE but found this much better, for me.
    Extensions - TODO
- PlatformIO

# My Hardware #
Not sponsored by Amazon but a easy fairly inexpensive place to get stuff with good shipping. I am a member of Amazon prime.
These are just what I used. You can substitute as you see fit, just change the code.

- Wires, any would do but I would use solid, easier.
